                    Having spent the last ten years as a chef working in fine
                    dining restaurants in the UK and France, I decided to change
                    path and pursue another passion of mine; a career in
                    software development.

                    When I'm not writing code or building websites you'll find
                    me with a guitar, playing badminton or taking long walks up
                    in the hills with the dog.
